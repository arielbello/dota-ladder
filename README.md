Dota Ladder Statistics
======================

A simple project to create a website displaying statistics from http://www.dota2.com/leaderboards.

How it should work
----------------------
This project bundles both the front-end and back-end. 

The front-end is a static webpage, but its content should be created and updated by its counterpart.

The back-end consists of Python scripts to scrap data using Selenium Webdriver (Firefox, gecko), 
then update the website's server with files reflecting a new data state.
This approach turns the front-end very light and simple, while the heavy-lifting,
complexity and setup are left to the back-end.

Project file structure
----------------------
- **software-engineering**: Files regarding my thought proccess to develop this project. 
Things like listing tasks and figuring out project components. Nothing to do with traditional software engineering.
- **scrapping**: Files related to web scrapping. The back-end part of this project. Done with Python using Selenium.
- **webpage**: Website files. The front-end part. The website part doesn't work only with these files, they need
the data generated by back-end (scrappers).
